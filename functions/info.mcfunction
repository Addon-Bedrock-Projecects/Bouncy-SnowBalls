tellraw @s {"rawtext":[{"text":"§2--------------------------------------\n§r--INFO----------------\n§gThis pack was creted by ConMaster2112. §7 \nAlso Slime block bouncy more!§r\n\n--How to Start---------\nYou can use other functions to use predefined templates. E.g.\n §7- /function tamplates/default§r\n\nOr you can make your own definition like throwing power in percentages and rebound power of each block as well. How to define them? For power of throwing item u have  to set specifig item name. E.g.\n§7 - /scoreboard players set \"minecraft:snowball\" powerMultiplier 150§8//150%\n§7 - /scoreboard players set \"minecraft:snowball\" powerMultiplier 75§8//75%§r\n\n And how to set rebound power of blocks? Like this E.g:\n§7 - /scoreboard players set \"minecraft:bedrock\" blockMultiplier 75§8//75%\n§7 - /scoreboard players set \"minecraft:grass\" blockMultiplier 125§8//75%§r\n\nBut the main thing for bounces to work at all is the need to define the number of bounces for snowballs. Jist do this:\n§7 - /scoreboard players set \"minecraft:snowball\" bouncy 5§8//It will bounce 5 times.\n\n§g--Warning--------------\nBe sure u have enabled §lGametest Experiments§r§g, also u have to use §ldefault template function§r§g to have no problems with inicialization. \nIf some think went wrong then use §lclear function§r§g.\n§2--------------------------------------"}]}
